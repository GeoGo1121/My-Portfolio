<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>great scenery, storytelling and progression of the plot.</p>
<h3>Tenet</h3>
<p>
overlooked masterpiece of Chris Nolan, <br />
needs a little bit of mindwrecking to understand.
</p>
<h3>Reservoir Dogs</h3>
<p>
Tarantino's first solo movie<br />
The ending is unexpected, writer makes you to think of the end of the story yourself.
